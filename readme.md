#Carbon
Carbon is a hackable performant PHP based static blogging system. 

_It should be considered early alpha._

##Aims

* Easy to learn
* Easy to hack & extend
* Performant

##Installation

Carbon requires PHP 5.3+ and has only been tested so far on IIS 6.1 / Windows.

1. Check out this repository and point your webserver to the public folder.
2. Open Configuration.php and override any constants from Defaults.php.
3. Open the site in your browser. A `cache` and `logs` folder outside `public` will be created, as well as a `public/content` folder.
